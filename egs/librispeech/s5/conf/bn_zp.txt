sing his get throw
tin bread blue more
pour this kids lead
jokes boats speak fast
trees nights from might
rock mom sea strange
apes home ducks clouds
soft these ice give
birds warm great fields
knees on sleep feels
sad slow cars bakes
chairs pink well wine
milk can swim girls
play mean help less
stain tape dull mice
old ball paint swing
shoes trash feet want
find worms coat tail
leaves joy high talk
guys late phones chalk
hats ears rat will
cups small at fresh
with chills me red
sharp thin books look
hurt tell laugh low
taste long cats thieves
lend men feet those
bright tea green catch
dumb good fall new
forks may shirts jump
good take sail sun
shine them won't wide
make meat teeth don't
hands cooks cows nails
that like fat smells
dog you sweet dad
out cool pens most
hot wear hit need
food boys kill fall
sound tough turn buys
