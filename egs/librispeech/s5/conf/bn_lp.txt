thin books look bright
wide pens swim fast
cats get good ears
feet catch slow thieves
ducks eat old tape
cups kill fat leaves
throw his rat ice
lead this coat home
green hands don't fall
pink chalk bakes phones
blue chairs speak well
dumb shoes will sing
find girls these clouds
tin hats may laugh
late forks hit low
knees talk with mice
teeth sleep on fields
sad cars want chills
lend them less joy
soft rocks taste strange
